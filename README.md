# DJS04 Project Brief: Book Connect - Web Components

# Project Overview
Building upon your "Book Connect" project in DJS03, you will now dive into Web Components. This challenge will refine your skills in creating reusable, encapsulated, and interactive elements.

# Project Brief
1. **Understand the Existing Codebase**: Familiarise yourself with the current structure and functionality of the "Book Connect" project, focusing on the book preview feature.
2. **Create a Web Component for Book Preview**:
   - Encapsulate the book preview into a Web Component.
   - Ensure that the component is self-contained, with its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Test the component to ensure it works seamlessly within the app.
3. **Identify and Convert Other Components**:
   - Analyse the application to identify other potential components for conversion.
   - Prioritise components based on their reusability and importance to the app.
   - Convert the chosen elements into Web Components.
4. **Testing and Integration**:
   - Rigorously test the new components individually and within the context of the application.
   - Pay special attention to interactions between components and the overall user experience.
5. **Documentation**:
   - Document the process of creating the Web Components.
   - Include any challenges faced and how they were overcome.
   - Provide a clear guide on how the components should be used within the app.

# Elements included

# Reflections 

### Areas of mastery 
- There were definitely no areas of mastery within this project, the whole concept of creating web components was a major struggle for me and it left me confused on way more than one occasion.  

### Challenges faced 
- Web components: the main brief itself was a huge challenge for me, I had challenges trying to find the correct syntax to use for web components. Apart from the syntax, I wasn't entirely certain how I could import the web component into the main script file, this created frustration and led to stagnancy  
### Areas of Improvement 
I would like to improve upon my research skills 

## Overall learning experience
This project took way longer than anticipated, I was not a huge fan of the learning process this time around and I believe this is in large due to the manner in which I research.
